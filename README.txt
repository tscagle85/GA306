Welcome!

	Within the project file, in scripts, are multiple python scripts for different light sets.  These are entirely adjustable, and are currently a rough build.  I have a few issues that I need to work out currently, and would like to update the light sets as needed.  However, the concept is still there.
	To use, select a light set code, and then execute each light individually (I haven’t managed to compile the code properly so they all build at once).  Each light has pre-set variables, including color, intensity, and position.  The position is set outside of the main grid to help users see where they populate.  All a user has to do is position as needed.

	There is a model that I did a little while ago that I used as a test hub for lighting, feel free to do the same!

- Future builds will have more variations in lighting, and will build all lights at the same time.
- I would like to add more lighting sets for more scenarios, suggestions are welcome!
- I am not a coder, but I am learning things as I go. =)
