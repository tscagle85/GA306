Welcome!

	Within the project file, in scripts, are multiple python scripts for different light sets.  These are entirely adjustable, and are currently a rough build.  I have a few issues that I need to work out currently, and would like to update the light sets as needed.  However, the concept is still there.
	To use, just load the light set that you would like to use, and execute like you would any other code.  Currently, each set has 3 lights: 1 directional and 2 point lights, all with varying degrees of intensity and colors.  I am still messing with them for better outcomes.

	There is a model that I did a little while ago that I used as a test hub for lighting, feel free to do the same!

- Future builds will have more variations in lighting
- I would like to add more lighting sets for more scenarios, suggestions are welcome!
- I am not a coder, but I am learning things as I go. =)
