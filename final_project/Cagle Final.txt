Tyler CagleGA306Final Project Check	The asset I want to use is a model I did in my first modeling class of Hawaiian Time in town here.  I like it because it’s simple, but has a decent amount of area to attempt to create the scripting that I want to do.  	As the final project, I want to create and demonstrate the ability to create different lighting sets for different scenarios.  For instance, lighting would be different in different seasons, or time of day.  I would like to attempt to adjust positioning through scripting as well.
